## Webpack Template

My personal Webpack template for front-end developement. Everyone interested can use it

**Instalation**

Create your project folder and copy files there. Open folder in terminal and type 

    $ npm i
(Node.js required)

**DevServer**

To start project type 

    $ npm start
 Go to http://localhost:4200/ and there you will have live reload server with project
 
**Build project**

When you are done, you will have to build your project

    $ npm run build
   This will build whole project into *dist* folder
